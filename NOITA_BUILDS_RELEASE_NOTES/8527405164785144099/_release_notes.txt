FEATURE: New perk: Levitation Trail
FEATURE: New physical wires and hazardous objects
FEATURE: New rope bridges
FEATURE: Proper worm ragdolls
FEATURE: Proper lukki ragdolls
 
UPDATE: Backgrounds blend together in a less edgy way
UPDATE: Kolmisilmä has a custom shield. Increased base HP. Ceiling collapse works more reliably.
UPDATE: Improved some common wood textures
UPDATE: New Orbroom graphics
UPDATE: Tubelights hang on wires and they can give electric shocks when broken
UPDATE: New background structures in Coal Pits
UPDATE: New background in Fungal Caverns
UPDATE: Improved lukki leg animation
UPDATE: Improved audio reverbs
UPDATE: Improved liquid audio
UPDATE: Improved audio mixing
UPDATE: Memory use optimization - reduced baseline memory use by 10-15%
UPDATE: File access optimization - less redundant copies

BUGFIX: Ragdoll joints weren't retained over a save-load cycle
BUGFIX: Lanterns and other props drifted spatially over a save-load cycle (fixed in some biomes)
BUGFIX: Mine cart sometimes had invisible forces holding it together when split in multiple parts
BUGFIX: Fixed some physical props losing their transform, destruction and other properties on a save-load cycle
